# **Bank Note Authentication - [Muhdad Alfaris Bachmid]**

## **1. Project Domain**
This project focuses on data classification using Machine Learning methods. The case study used is **banknote authentication classification** based on numerical characteristics extracted from banknote images.

### **Background**
In the financial world, **counterfeit money** is one of the major problems affecting the global economy. Identifying the authenticity of banknotes manually is time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, a technology-based solution is needed to improve accuracy and efficiency in **detecting counterfeit money**.

Previous research has shown that **Machine Learning** methods can be used to classify banknotes based on extracted features using statistical analysis such as **variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy**.

### **Why Should This Problem Be Solved?**
- Improve efficiency in detecting counterfeit money.
- Reduce reliance on manual methods prone to errors.
- Provide a fast automated solution that can be integrated into banking systems.
